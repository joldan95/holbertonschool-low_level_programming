# Bit manipulation project

## Summary

Project to understand the uses of bit operators on C

## Functions

It would implement exercises to understand the bit manipulation on C

File (function) | Use
----------------|-----
0-binary_to_unit.c | Converts a binary number to an unsigned int and returns it
1-print_binary.c | Prints the binary representation of a number
2-get_bit.c | Returns the value of a bit at a given index and return the value of the bit at index or -1
3-set_bit.c | Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index and return 1 if worked or -1 if not
4-clear_bit.c | Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index and return 1 if worked or -1 if not
5-flip_bits.c | Returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
